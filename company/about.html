    <h1>My self</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Rob Geis and I am currently in grade 12. I have been at
      County High School for a year now; I joined at the start of 11th grade,
      and have thoroughly enjoyed myself here. The school is great, the people
      are fantastic and the atmosphere is one that makes you actually want to go
      to school. Before I joined ASB I was studying at the Singapore American
      School for two years and prior to that I was at the International School
      of Kuala Lumpur for two years. I was born and raised here in Bombay city
      and grew up here. I am an interesting, fun loving guy with a good sense of
      humor. One thing about me that is important to know though is that at
      first I come of as a very shy individualistic guy but once I get to know
      people and are comfortable with my environment I am great. It is hard for
      me to make friends but once I make them, itâ€™s great and I am all
      different. I joke, laugh and humor people and I also get as much as I
      give. I am a very kind, compassionate, sensitive guy as my close friends
      will tell you. I have a tough shell but on the inside I am soft. I am also
      a very principled person and stand strong on what is right and wrong. I am
      also a very straight and honest person. I understand and know that we all
      put on a show sometimes and do not show who we really are or what we feel
      but some people do this constantly and those kinds of people I cannot
      stand.
